# mc-world-slices
 
This repository has the world file and litematic files for my build world.

For the sake of a smaller world size, git is used to discard all unnecessary region files, only builds are committed to the repository.

### Coordinates and litematics

- [Medieval Watermill](https://github.com/Zefyro/mc-world-slices/releases/download/1.20.1/medieval_watermill.litematic): `/tp @s 3800 80 -6000`
